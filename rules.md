Movement

Enemy design

default action which can always be done, and its value must be of at least 1 turn, so stalling is inhibited

conditional actions

i need help with designing enemies, mainly a relation between its movement pattern an action

The enemy is a bandit in a low fantasy setting, lets start with 2 actions, first action is one that can always be used. and the second one is a conditional more offensive type.

The always action must be more powerful than conditional ones so that the players would be deterred to stall the fight
